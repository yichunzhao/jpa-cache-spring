# jpa-cache-spring
Setup the 2nd level JPA cache with Springboot



* Good practices for Many-to-Many with JPA-Hibernate

* Model associations as a Set

* Bi-lateral association and provide utility methods

* Always use FetchType.Lazy: 
using joint-fetch; named entity graph; 
joint-fetch is almost identical to a simple join clause in a JPQL query. Altough they look similar but Joint-fectch has much impact on the generated SQL query. 

* Don't use CascadeTye Remove and ALL.
