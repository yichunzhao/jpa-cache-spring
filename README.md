* Good practices for Many-to-Many with JPA-Hibernate

* model associations as a Set

* bi-lateral association and provide utility methods

* always use FetchType.Lazy

when adn how to use query-specific fetching: 
using joint-fetch; named entity graph; 
joint-fetch is almost identical to a simple join clause in a JPQL query. Altough they look similar but Joint-fectch has much impact on the generated SQL query. 

* Don't use CascadeTye Remove and ALL.
